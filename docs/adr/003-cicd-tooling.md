# ADR 003: CI/CD Tooling

**Date**: 2024-01-01  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: DevOps Team, ML Engineering Team  

## Context

We need to establish a CI/CD pipeline for our ML project that supports:

- Code quality gates (linting, testing, security scanning)
- Model training and validation
- Automated deployment to multiple environments
- Integration with our GitHub-based development workflow
- Cost-effective operation for a team-sized project

Key requirements:
- Integration with GitHub repository
- Support for Docker containers
- Ability to run ML training workloads
- Secrets management for cloud credentials
- Matrix testing across Python versions
- Artifact management for trained models

Options considered:
- **GitHub Actions** (native GitHub integration)
- **GitLab CI/CD** (comprehensive DevOps platform)
- **Jenkins** (self-hosted, highly customizable)
- **CircleCI** (cloud-based, Docker-native)
- **Azure DevOps** (Microsoft ecosystem)

## Decision

We will use **GitHub Actions** as our primary CI/CD platform.

### Rationale

1. **Native Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub repository and pull requests
2. **Cost Effectiveness**: Free for public repositories, competitive pricing for private
3. **Ecosystem**: Rich marketplace of pre-built actions
4. **Container Support**: Native Docker support with good performance
5. **Matrix Builds**: Easy parallel testing across multiple environments
6. **Secrets Management**: Built-in secure secrets handling
7. **Community**: Large community and extensive documentation

### Workflow Architecture

We implement three main workflows:

1. **CI Workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Triggered on push/PR to main branches
   - Code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
   - Unit and integration testing
   - Security scanning with bandit
   - Coverage reporting

2. **Training Workflow** (`.github/workflows/train.yml`)
   - Triggered manually or on schedule
   - Model training with MLflow tracking
   - Model validation and testing
   - Model registration in MLflow registry

3. **Deployment Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
   - Triggered on successful training or manual trigger
   - Build and push Docker images to ECR
   - Deploy to AWS ECS
   - Health checks and rollback capabilities

## Implementation Details

### CI Workflow Structure
```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  quality-gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run quality gates
        run: make quality-gates
```

### Training Workflow Features
- GPU runner support for training workloads
- MLflow experiment tracking integration
- Model artifact storage and versioning
- Automated model validation pipelines
- Slack/email notifications for training completion

### Deployment Workflow Features
- Multi-environment deployment (staging, production)
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated rollback on health check failures
- Integration with AWS services (ECS, ECR, RDS)

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ **Zero Setup**: No infrastructure to maintain
- ✅ **Cost Effective**: Free tier covers most development needs
- ✅ **GitHub Integration**: Native PR checks and status reporting
- ✅ **Marketplace**: Thousands of pre-built actions available
- ✅ **Parallel Execution**: Matrix builds and parallel jobs
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Support for Linux, Windows, macOS
- ✅ **Container Native**: Excellent Docker support

### Negative
- ❌ **Vendor Lock-in**: Tied to GitHub platform
- ❌ **Limited Customization**: Less flexible than self-hosted solutions
- ❌ **Resource Limits**: Constrained by GitHub's runner specifications
- ❌ **Network Restrictions**: Limited outbound connectivity options

### Mitigation Strategies

**Resource Limitations:**
- Use self-hosted runners for intensive ML training workloads
- Implement efficient caching strategies for dependencies
- Optimize Docker layer caching

**Vendor Lock-in:**
- Use standard tools (Make, Docker) that work across platforms
- Document migration procedures to other CI/CD platforms
- Avoid GitHub-specific features where possible

**Security:**
- Use OIDC for cloud provider authentication
- Implement least-privilege access for secrets
- Regular security audits of workflow permissions

## Quality Gates Implementation

Our CI pipeline implements comprehensive quality gates:

```yaml
quality-gates:
  steps:
    - name: Code Formatting
      run: |
        black --check src tests
        isort --check-only src tests
    
    - name: Linting
      run: |
        ruff check src tests
        mypy src
    
    - name: Security Scanning
      run: bandit -r src
    
    - name: Testing
      run: |
        pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml
        
    - name: Upload Coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Workflow failure notifications via Slack
- Performance metrics tracking for build times
- Regular security scanning updates
- Cost monitoring for runner usage

## Future Considerations

- Evaluate self-hosted runners for cost optimization
- Consider GitHub Codespaces for development environments
- Explore GitHub Packages for artifact management
- Implement advanced deployment strategies (canary, feature flags)
