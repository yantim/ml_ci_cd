# ADR 001: Choice of Machine Learning Framework

**Date**: 2024-01-01  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: ML Engineering Team  

## Context

We need to select a machine learning framework for developing and deploying models in our CI/CD pipeline. The framework must support:

- Neural network training and inference
- Natural Language Processing tasks
- Model serialization and versioning
- Integration with MLflow
- Production-ready serving capabilities
- Strong community support and documentation

Key options considered:
- **PyTorch** with Hugging Face Transformers
- **TensorFlow** with TensorFlow Hub
- **JAX** with Flax
- **Scikit-learn** for traditional ML

## Decision

We will use **PyTorch as the primary ML framework** combined with **Hugging Face Transformers** for NLP tasks.

### Rationale

1. **Ecosystem Maturity**: PyTorch has excellent integration with MLflow, Docker, and cloud platforms
2. **Hugging Face Integration**: Provides access to thousands of pre-trained models and seamless fine-tuning capabilities
3. **Dynamic Computation**: PyTorch's dynamic graphs make debugging and experimentation easier
4. **Production Readiness**: TorchServe and MLflow PyFunc provide robust serving options
5. **Community Support**: Large, active community with extensive documentation
6. **Flexibility**: Suitable for both research and production environments

### Implementation Details

- Use PyTorch 2.0+ for training with native compilation support
- Leverage Hugging Face Transformers for NLP model architectures
- Implement custom PyTorch Lightning modules for structured training loops
- Use MLflow PyFunc for model packaging and serving
- Employ ONNX for cross-platform model deployment when needed

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Rich ecosystem of pre-trained models via Hugging Face
- ✅ Excellent debugging and development experience
- ✅ Strong integration with MLflow and serving platforms
- ✅ Active community and frequent updates
- ✅ Good performance with minimal optimization effort

### Negative
- ❌ Larger memory footprint compared to some alternatives
- ❌ Need to manage dependency compatibility between PyTorch versions
- ❌ Some production optimizations require additional tools (ONNX, TensorRT)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use Docker containers to ensure consistent environments
- Implement comprehensive testing for version compatibility
- Plan for gradual migration paths if framework changes are needed
- Maintain documentation for optimization best practices
